Hi again!
So this is my second recreation of a website, based on a design concept, and in my last project, I said the concept I'll be working on will be one of [Adhiari Subekti](https://dribbble.com/Adhiari_is)'s and that I already had chosen it.
<br> However, things didn't went as expected, so I decided to look for other inspirations, when I came across [**Ronas IT | UI/UX Team**](https://dribbble.com/ronasit) - a team which had such cool designs. That's when I saw the design and I knew that *this* was the one I was going to do!
<br><br>
So, with that said, I hope you enjoy it and **huge thanks** to Ronas IT for the inspiration! ðŸ’–
